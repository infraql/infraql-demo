A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.\n\nFor some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`.
